# Monolith Editorial Guide

> Served by the `monolith_guide` MCP action. Call `monolith_guide()` for this whole map, or `monolith_guide(section="recipes")` to pull one section and bound your context cost. Each `## ` header below is a section key.
>
> This guide is **editorial** — it teaches cross-namespace workflows, decisions, and recovery. It does **not** restate the per-namespace action catalog (see `Docs/API_REFERENCE.md`) or the pipeline chains (see `Docs/SPEC_CORE.md` §13 Pipelines). It assumes you have only the Monolith plugin installed and a running Unreal Editor — no other scaffolding.

## onboarding

You are an AI agent driving an Unreal Engine editor through Monolith's MCP tools. Three calls orient you before you touch anything:

1. **`monolith_discover()`** — no arguments. Returns the namespace inventory: every namespace, its action count, and which optional namespaces are gated off in this project (e.g. `gas`, `combograph`, `logicdriver` only register when their plugin is present). This response also carries a `guide_hint` pointing back here. Call `monolith_discover("<namespace>")` to get the full action list for one namespace (terse by default: action names + one-line descriptions) — do this before calling any action you have not used. For an action's full **parameter schema**, call `describe_query("action_schema", ...)` (or pass `detail=true` to `monolith_discover` to inline every action's schema), rather than guessing argument names.
2. **`monolith_status()`** — confirms the editor is reachable, reports the plugin version and the live total action count. If this fails or the MCP connection drops, the editor is down — nothing else will work until it is back up.
3. **`monolith_guide(section="recipes")`** — pull the worked cross-namespace examples once you know what you want to build.

Each `monolith_discover("<namespace>")` costs real tokens — even terse (names + one-line descriptions), a large namespace's listing is sizeable, and `detail=true` (full schemas) is far heavier. Spend that cost intentionally: discover the one or two namespaces your task needs, not all of them, and reach for `describe_query("action_schema", ...)` when you only need one action's schema. The surface is large — roughly 1600+ actions across ~30 namespaces — and shifts between releases, so never rely on an exact count written in prose: trust the live `monolith_discover()` / `monolith_status()` figure over any number you read here or in the docs.

The golden rule underneath all of this: **discover before you guess.** Action names, parameter names, and which namespaces exist are all answerable at runtime. Fabricating any of them wastes a round-trip on a guaranteed error.

## recipes

These are cross-namespace flows that no single namespace's docs cover. Each step names `namespace.action` and ends with a verify call. For single-asset authoring chains (one material, one Sound Cue, one state machine), use the pipelines in `Docs/SPEC_CORE.md` §13 instead — the recipes here are the multi-namespace cases.

**Pointer — spec builders.** Several namespaces expose a `build_*_from_spec` family (`build_material_graph` with a `graph_spec`, `build_sm_from_spec`, `build_sound_cue_from_spec`, `build_ui_from_spec`, and others). These are transactional: one call populates a whole graph with validation, connection resolution, and rollback. Prefer them over hand-sequencing `create → add → connect`. Discover the exact spec shape with `monolith_discover("<namespace>")` and read the schema for the builder action.

**Recipe 1 — Ship a melee ability with audio and HUD feedback.**
1. `gas.create_gameplay_ability` — author the ability asset (gated on `WITH_GBA`).
2. `gas.create_gameplay_effect` — the damage/cost effect the ability applies.
3. `audio.create_sound_cue` (or `audio.build_sound_cue_from_spec`) — the swing/impact sound.
4. `gas.add_gameplay_cue` — bind the cue tag so the ability triggers the sound.
5. `ui.create_widget_blueprint` then `ui.bind_widget_to_attribute` — wire a cooldown/health readout to the attribute set.
6. **Verify:** `gas_query("get_ability_info", ...)` confirms the ability's effects/cues; `ui_query("compile_widget", ...)` confirms the HUD compiles clean.

**Recipe 2 — Build a horror prop with a particle effect and impact material.**
1. `material.create_material` then `material.build_material_graph` (pass a `graph_spec`) — the surface shader.
2. `niagara.create_niagara_system` — the ambient/impact VFX.
3. `mesh.spawn_actor` (or place a Static Mesh) and assign the material — set its Outliner folder via the action's folder parameter so the scene stays organized.
4. **Verify:** `material_query("recompile_material", ...)` returns no errors; `niagara_query("get_system_info", ...)` confirms emitters; `mesh_query` overlap/raycast confirms placement.

**Recipe 3 — Author an AI encounter that reacts to sound.**
1. `ai.create_behavior_tree` (or State Tree) — the patrol/chase logic (gated on `WITH_STATETREE` / `WITH_SMARTOBJECTS`).
2. `ai.add_perception_to_actor` — give the AI hearing/sight.
3. `audio.bind_sound_to_perception` — make a Sound Cue emit a perception stimulus the AI hears.
4. `logicdriver.build_sm_from_spec` — optional higher-level state flow (gated on `WITH_LOGICDRIVER`).
5. **Verify:** `ai_query("get_bt_graph", ...)` confirms the tree; trigger PIE via `editor_query("start_pie")` and watch the perception fire.

**Recipe 4 — Stand up a settings menu.**
1. `ui.scaffold_settings_panel_with_tabs` — generates the tabbed panel shell.
2. `ui.build_menu_from_spec` — populate options from a JSON spec.
3. `ui.apply_token_binding` — bind to a design-token style set if you use one.
4. **Verify:** `ui_query("compile_widget", ...)` returns empty `errors[]`; `ui_query("audit_focus_chain", ...)` confirms gamepad navigation.

**Recipe 5 — Visual introspection: going beyond thumbnails.** Default content-browser thumbnails are 256² and rendered with editor defaults — fine for identification, useless for tech-art inspection. Three `editor::` actions raise fidelity.
1. `editor.capture_scene_preview` — render ONE asset on a preview mesh at the resolution and angle you choose. `asset_type` accepts `material`, `niagara`, `static_mesh`, `skeletal_mesh` (with optional `animation_path` + `seek_time` for a posed-frame capture), and `widget` (UMG via `FWidgetRenderer`, with `scale` DPI multiplier). Example: `editor_query("capture_scene_preview", {asset_type: "skeletal_mesh", asset_path: "/Game/Characters/SK_Hero", animation_path: "/Game/Characters/Anims/AS_Idle", seek_time: 0.5, output_path: "D:/captures/hero_idle.png", width: 1024, height: 1024})`.
2. `editor.capture_with_overlay` — same single-asset capture path, but renders under an engine debug-view show flag for tech-art inspection. Modes: `wireframe`, `normals`, `uv_density`, `lightmap_density`, `shader_complexity`. Example: `editor_query("capture_with_overlay", {asset_path: "/Game/Meshes/SM_Rock", overlay_mode: "shader_complexity", output_path: "D:/captures/rock_complexity.png"})`.
3. `editor.capture_material_grid` — render N material instances side-by-side under shared lighting in a single PNG. Auto-grid via `ceil(sqrt(N))`; pass `columns` to override. Example: `editor_query("capture_material_grid", {material_instances: ["/Game/Materials/MI_Stone_A", "/Game/Materials/MI_Stone_B", "/Game/Materials/MI_Stone_C", "/Game/Materials/MI_Stone_D"], output_path: "D:/captures/stones_grid.png"})`.

All three are editor-only, render-thread-enqueue style, and return `{success, output_path, width, height}`.

**Recipe 6 — Reading asset structure without rendering.** When you need structured data (parameter names, channel statistics, packing detection) rather than a picture, two `editor::` inspect actions walk the asset reflectively — pure JSON, no render-thread cost.
1. `editor.inspect_material_pbr` — walks a material's texture parameter list, classifies each by PBR role (`base_color`, `normal`, `roughness`, `metallic`, `ao`, `emissive`, `orm`, `arm`, `mra`, etc.), and detects ORM / ARM / MRA channel-packing on the source textures. Returns `{slots: {base_color_texture: ..., normal_texture: ..., ...}, packed_channels: [{texture, packing}], unmapped_parameters: [...]}`. Example: `editor_query("inspect_material_pbr", {asset_path: "/Game/Materials/M_Concrete"})`.
2. `editor.inspect_texture_channels` — locks the source mip read-only and reports per-channel statistics (R/G/B/A min, max, mean) plus the source format and dimensions. Optional `emit_splits=true` writes one PNG per channel for visual diff. Returns `{width, height, format, channel_stats: {r: {min, max, mean}, g: {...}, b: {...}, a: {...}}, split_paths?}`. Example: `editor_query("inspect_texture_channels", {asset_path: "/Game/Textures/T_Concrete_ORM", emit_splits: true, output_dir: "D:/splits/"})`.

Prefer the inspect actions over capture when downstream logic needs to branch on the data (e.g. "if this is ORM-packed, route channel R to AO; if not, treat the slot as standalone Roughness"). Prefer capture when a human or a vision model needs to look at the pixels.

**Recipe 7 — Tuning Niagara timing without hand-walking the module stack.** Authoring a system's warmup, loop topology, sim-stage iteration counts, and particle lifetime used to mean per-property `set_system_property` / `set_static_switch_value` / `set_module_input_value` round-trips against `EmitterState` and `InitializeParticle`. The temporal-control surface collapses that into intent-named composite writers.
1. `niagara.get_system_timing` — bundled read of `WarmupTime` / `WarmupTickCount` / `WarmupTickDelta` / `bFixedTickDelta` / `FixedTickDeltaTime` / `bRequireCurrentFrameData` in one call. Use this to inspect before you write — and to observe the engine-resolved triple after `set_warmup_profile`, since `UNiagaraSystem::SetWarmupTime` snaps `WarmupTickCount` via `ResolveWarmupTickCount`.
2. `niagara.set_warmup_profile` — composite write that dispatches `SetWarmupTime` + `SetWarmupTickDelta` and returns the engine-resolved triple. Pair with `set_fixed_tick_delta` / `set_require_current_frame_data` for the rest of the system-level timing knobs.
3. `niagara.set_emitter_loop_profile` — composite write of EmitterState loop topology (`loop_behavior` / `loop_duration` / `loop_delay` / `loop_count` / `loop_delay_enabled`). For standalone `UNiagaraStatelessEmitter` (Lightweight Emitter) assets, pass the optional `loop_duration_mode` (`"Fixed"` / `"Infinite"`); the action detects stateless assets via class-name match and dispatches into the reflection-based write path against the protected `EmitterState` `FNiagaraEmitterStateData`.
4. `niagara.set_sim_stage_iteration_count` / `niagara.set_sim_stage_execute_behavior` — sim-stage aliases over `set_simulation_stage_property` using PR #65's `stage_index` / `stage_name` selector.
5. `niagara.set_particle_lifetime` — convenience write to `InitializeParticle`. `min` only → Direct mode constant `Lifetime`; `min` + `max` → Random mode `Lifetime Min` + `Lifetime Max`.
6. **Verify:** `niagara_query("get_emitter_timing_summary", ...)` — read aggregator returning loop topology + `sim_stages[]` + `InitializeParticle` lifetime fields. On standalone stateless assets it returns `stateless: true` with `null` lifetime fields and `sim_stages: []`.

**Recipe 8 — Authoring a Lightweight (stateless) emitter from scratch.** `UNiagaraStatelessEmitter` lives outside the System wrapper and uses Internal/Stateless/ headers most modules can't link to. `niagara.create_stateless_emitter` factors that out.
1. `niagara.create_stateless_emitter` — author the standalone asset at `save_path`. Uses `FindObject<UClass>(nullptr, "/Script/Niagara.NiagaraStatelessEmitter")` + type-erased `NewObject` so callers don't need a hard module dep on Niagara internals.
2. `niagara.set_emitter_loop_profile` — same action as the stateful path; pass `loop_duration_mode` (`"Fixed"` / `"Infinite"`) to set the stateless-only knob. Stateful systems emit a warning if `loop_duration_mode` is supplied because the stateful `EmitterState` module has no equivalent input.
3. **Verify:** `niagara_query("get_emitter_timing_summary", {asset_path: "/Game/.../SLE_Foo"})` returns `stateless: true` and the topology you set.

**Recipe 9 — Authoring custom (GAS-free) primary data assets.** When your project defines its own native `UPrimaryDataAsset` (or any non-Actor, non-Blueprint `UObject`) subclass, you do **not** need the `gas` namespace or any GAS plugin — `blueprint.seed_data_asset` creates the asset and reflection-populates its `UPROPERTY` fields from a JSON tree, with dry-run validation. It accepts any concrete class that is not abstract, deprecated, Actor-derived, or a Blueprint class, so a native `UPrimaryDataAsset` subclass passes the class guard with zero GAS coupling.
1. **Dry-run first** — validate the tree against the class CDO without writing anything:
   `blueprint seed_data_asset { save_path: "/Game/Data/DA_Foo", class_name: "YourDataAssetClass", tree: { ... }, dry_run: true }`
   The response reports each would-be field write (`field_writes[]`) and `would_apply`. Fix any rejected paths before committing.
2. **Commit** — re-issue with `dry_run: false` to create and save the asset.
3. **Object-reference fields and arrays are supported.** A hard object-ref field (`TObjectPtr<USomeClass>`) takes an asset-path **string** (resolved via `StaticLoadObject`); an array of refs (`TArray<TObjectPtr<USomeClass>>`) takes a JSON **array of asset-path strings** — the reflection walker dispatches each element through the same object-ref resolver. Soft refs (`TSoftObjectPtr<...>`) take their path string too. Example tree fragment: `{ "Icon": "/Game/UI/T_Icon", "RelatedItems": ["/Game/Data/DA_Bar", "/Game/Data/DA_Baz"] }`.
4. **Read the field shape first** if unsure — `class_name` resolution tries the name as-is, then with a `U`/`A` prefix; pass a full `/Script/Module.ClassName` path to disambiguate. Use `blueprint_query("get_cdo_properties", ...)` to inspect the writable fields before building the tree.
5. **Verify the write landed** — `blueprint.seed_data_asset` takes `read_back_values: true` to echo the saved field values straight from the just-written asset, and `blueprint_query("get_cdo_properties", ...)` reads them live from the asset object. Prefer either over `project_query("get_asset_details", ...)`, which serves a **stale indexed snapshot** (it lags the actual asset until the index re-scans) and will happily report old values after a fresh write.

**Recipe 10 — Prove a nested chooser remap from readback (not from the write call).** A write that reports success only means the call returned — to prove a chooser row actually points where you intend, read the resolved table back.
1. `chooser.inspect_chooser` with `recursive: true` — returns the full table including **nested** chooser tables inline, so a row that delegates to a sub-chooser is resolved in one call rather than chasing references by hand.
2. For chooser tables embedded in an AnimGraph: `animation.get_anim_graph_choosers` lists the choosers a given AnimBP's graph references, and `animation.get_nodes` with `include_anim_graph: true` surfaces the AnimGraph nodes (chooser players, blend nodes) that consume them.
3. **Verify:** compare the readback's resolved output class/asset per row against your intended remap. Trust the readback, not the write call's `success` flag.

**Recipe 11 — Author and confirm an AnimBP transition rule.** Transition rules between states can be authored as a structured comparison rather than a hand-wired Boolean graph.
1. `animation.set_transition_rule` with `kind: "compare"` — sets the rule as a typed comparison (a variable/property compared against a value with an operator), avoiding manual node wiring.
2. **Verify:** `animation.get_transition_rule` reads the rule back in structured form so you can confirm the operator, operands, and that it landed on the intended transition.

**Recipe 12 — Inspect inherited native components on a Blueprint.** Components added in a C++ base class are easy to miss because they are not in the Blueprint's own SimpleConstructionScript.
1. `get_blueprint_info` — its `native_component_count` tells you how many components come from native base classes (vs Blueprint-added).
2. `blueprint.get_component_details` — resolves a component's details, falling back to the inherited-native lookup when the component lives on a C++ base rather than in the Blueprint graph, so inherited components report their real class and properties.

**Recipe 13 — Profile a PIE session and capture movement.** Drive a Play-In-Editor session and collect timing + a movement clip without leaving the MCP surface.
1. `editor.actor_setup` — spawn an actor, apply a DataAsset to it, and/or move it into position for the scenario you want to profile.
2. `editor.csv_profile` (start/stop a CSV profiling capture) with `trace_channels` to scope which trace channels the session records — keeps the capture focused instead of recording everything.
3. `editor.capture_pie_movement_clip` with `discard_first_frames: N` — records a movement clip while dropping the first N frames (PIE warm-up / hitch frames that would skew the data); the capture is label-aware and follows the view target you set.
4. **Verify:** inspect the returned CSV/clip paths; the discarded-frame count and trace-channel set are echoed back so you can confirm the capture was scoped as intended.

**Recipe 14 — Author map settings (GameMode override, PlayerStarts).** Configure a world's settings and spawn points in one transactional call.
1. `editor.author_map_settings` (or `editor.create_nav_harness_map` for a fresh harness map) — set `game_mode_override` (a typed `AGameModeBase`-subclass path), `player_starts` (an array of `{location, rotation}` objects), and other typed/array world-settings props in one call.
2. **Idempotent by design:** re-applying the same `game_mode_override` is a no-op — the call only dirties the package when the class actually differs, and the response reports `game_mode_override_changed: false` when nothing changed. Use that flag to confirm whether a re-run mutated anything.

**Recipe 15 — Prove a graph edit landed.** A write action's `success: true` means the call did not throw. It does not mean the graph is in the shape you intended, and `set_node_property`'s `ReconstructNode()` drops links on renamed pins **silently**. Verify structurally, never by the success flag.
1. `blueprint.export_graph` — **save this payload.** It is both your rollback record and your assertion baseline. (This reads the live `UEdGraph`, not an index — the staleness warning under Recipe 9 applies to `project_query("get_asset_details")`, not to the graph readers.)
2. `blueprint.get_graph_fingerprint` — record the "before" hash. Node identity is semantic (function+class, event name, variable name, macro, cast class), not the `K2Node_*_NN` instance name, so a delete-and-re-add of an identical node does not move the fingerprint.
3. Mutate — `add_node` / `connect_pins` / `set_node_property` / `remove_node`.
4. `blueprint.compile_blueprint` — not clean means **stop**. Do not continue a batch on a broken graph.
5. `blueprint.assert_graph_matches` — pass a trimmed `export_graph` payload as `spec`. Add `spec.forbidden_nodes: [{class, function}]` to assert a replaced node is really *gone*. A miss returns **success with `matched: false`** plus `missing_nodes` / `missing_connections` / `pin_default_mismatches` — branch on that field rather than wrapping the call in error handling.
6. `blueprint.get_graph_fingerprint` again — record the "after" hash alongside the before, so the next session can detect drift.
7. `save_asset`.

**One asset per transaction.** Never mutate a second Blueprint before asserting the first — if the assertion fails you want exactly one thing to roll back.

**Before trusting any of this, prove the fingerprint is stable:** call `get_graph_fingerprint` twice on an untouched graph and once more after a no-op resave, and require byte-identical output. A flaky fingerprint teaches an agent to ignore assertions, which is worse than having no assertions at all.

**Recipe 16 — Author a whole node cluster in one shot (T3D injection).** Recipe 15 assumes you mutate with `add_node`/`connect_pins`. For anything bigger than two or three nodes that is the slow and dangerous path: every call is a round trip, and a failure halfway through leaves a half-wired graph you now have to unpick by hand. `inject_nodes_t3d` lands the whole cluster in one transaction instead.
0. **Prove the graph is on the live path.** `python Tools/bp_live_path.py <asset>` — abort on `ORPHAN` or `AMBIGUOUS`. Every step below verifies that your change landed *in the graph you named*; none of them can tell you whether anything instantiates that graph's owner, and injecting into an unreachable graph is worse than a bad payload because it **succeeds**. This has cost the project twice: `BP_BattleUI` had a live exec chain nothing constructed, and a lane remap landed on a component only an unconfigured GameMode adds. `AMBIGUOUS` matters just as much — `BP_BattleUI` exists in two copies with two `BP_BattleController`s, and a substring assertion passes against either.
1. **Get a known-good payload.** Wire the shape once by hand in the editor, select it, `Ctrl+C`, paste into a file — that clipboard text *is* T3D. (`export_graph` gives you JSON, which is for reading and asserting, not for injecting.)
2. **Parameterise it.** Replace each `NodeGuid=` and each pin `PinId=` with `{{GUID:name}}`. One distinct name mints one guid per call, so using the same name on a node's guid and inside another node's `LinkedTo=(...)` is what makes the link survive. Use `{{token}}` + the `placeholders` map for asset paths, function names, and defaults.
3. `blueprint.validate_nodes_t3d` — pre-flight with **zero** risk of mutation. Returns `valid` plus `findings[]`.
4. `blueprint.get_graph_fingerprint` — record "before", exactly as in Recipe 15.
5. `blueprint.inject_nodes_t3d` — one call, one transaction, `compile: true`. Check `compiled_clean` and `nodes_injected`.
6. `blueprint.get_graph_fingerprint` + `assert_graph_matches` — prove it landed. `save_asset`.

**Why the pre-flight is not optional.** `CanImportNodesFromText` is UE's own gate and it is far more permissive than it looks: a `K2Node_CallFunction` whose `MemberName` no longer exists on its `MemberParent` passes it cleanly, imports, and shows up as a red node. `engine_accepts: true` with `valid: false` is the normal shape of that failure — which is why `inject_nodes_t3d` runs the reflection check itself and refuses. **A pre-flight failure aborts before the graph is touched**, so a payload where node 1 is fine and node 7 references a renamed function leaves the graph byte-identical rather than 6 nodes deep.

**It reports `valid: false`, it does not error.** Same convention as `assert_graph_matches` — branch on `valid` / `injected`, don't wrap it in error handling.

**A fingerprint covers one graph, and contracts span several.** `get_graph_fingerprint` and `assert_graph_matches` take a `graph_name`. If the thing you changed has a counterpart elsewhere in the same Blueprint, nothing here will notice you only did half of it. Worked example from 2026-08-08: the battle lane keys were remapped to Q/W/O/P in `BP_BattleUI.OnKeyDown`, but `OnKeyUp` — which clears the pressed state with the *same four keys* — was left on D/F/J/K. Compile clean, fingerprint moved, closure invariants 10/10, and every lane latched lit on first press for the rest of the session. Before you assert, ask which *other* graph encodes the same fact.

**Guid collisions are handled, but re-injection is still not idempotent.** The action forces unique `NodeGuid`s on import (colliding guids break fingerprinting and the editor's own diffing), so injecting the same payload twice gives you two working copies of the cluster, not one. There is no dedupe. If you are re-running, delete first or assert absence.

## decisions

When two tools overlap, pick by intent:

- **`build_material_graph` (with `graph_spec`) vs `bulk_fill_query("apply")`.** Use `build_material_graph` to author a material's expression graph — it understands material nodes and connections. Use `bulk_fill_query("apply", target_namespace=..., target=...)` to set many *properties* on an existing asset in one reflection-driven write (e.g. populating a DataAsset or a component's fields). Builders shape graphs; bulk_fill shapes property trees. Read the writable field tree first with `describe_query("schema", ...)`.
- **`live_compile` vs UBT.** `editor_query("live_compile")` hot-patches `.cpp`-only changes into the running editor — fast, in-memory, lost on restart. Any **header** change (new class, changed signature, new `UPROPERTY`/`UFUNCTION`) needs a full UnrealBuildTool build plus an editor restart; Live Coding cannot pick up new compiled symbols. If a live_compile "succeeds" but the new symbol isn't found, you changed a header — rebuild.
- **`source_query` vs `project_query`.** `source_query` searches **C++ engine/plugin source** (signatures, includes, class hierarchies) — use it to verify an API before writing code. `project_query` searches **content assets** (Blueprints, materials, meshes by path/name/type) — use it to find or confirm an asset exists before referencing it.
- **`monolith_discover` vs `monolith_guide`.** `monolith_discover` is the machine surface — exact action names + one-line descriptions (terse by default; pass `detail=true` or call `describe_query("action_schema", ...)` for an action's full param schema). `monolith_guide` (this tool) is the editorial layer — *why* and *in what order*. Discover tells you the verbs; the guide tells you the sentences.
- **`bulk_fill_query` vs `describe_query`.** `describe_query("schema", ...)` is read-only: it returns the authoritative field tree (paths, ImportText grammar, ranges, enum values) for an adapter namespace. `bulk_fill_query("apply", ...)` performs the write. Describe to learn the shape, bulk_fill to commit it; `bulk_fill_query("list_namespaces")` shows which adapters are available.
- **`capture_scene_preview` vs `capture_material_grid` vs `inspect_material_pbr`.** Three actions that look adjacent but solve different problems:
  - `editor.capture_scene_preview` — ONE material/asset rendered on a preview mesh, returns a single PNG. Use when you need a higher-fidelity thumbnail than the content-browser default.
  - `editor.capture_material_grid` — N material instances side-by-side in a shared scene, returns ONE composite PNG. Use when comparing variations (stone palette, skin tones, decal alphabet) is the goal.
  - `editor.inspect_material_pbr` — NO rendering. Walks the parameter list and returns structured JSON (PBR slot classification + ORM/ARM/MRA channel-packing detection). Use when downstream logic needs to branch on the data rather than look at pixels.

## errors

Workflow-level recovery — the map from a symptom to the fix. (Individual action error messages already carry inline recovery hints; this is the higher-level view.)

- **`LIVE_CODING_BLOCKED` / "Unable to build while Live Coding is active."** The editor is open and holding the build lock. Close the editor, run the UBT build, then reopen. For `.cpp`-only changes you can instead `editor_query("live_compile")` without closing.
- **"Unknown namespace" / a namespace you expected is missing from `monolith_discover()`.** That namespace is gated behind an optional plugin and the gate is off in this project. `gas` needs GameplayAbilities (`WITH_GBA`), `combograph` needs ComboGraph, `logicdriver` needs Logic Driver Pro, `ai` needs StateTree + SmartObjects, MetaSound audio actions need MetaSound. Install/enable the plugin and rebuild, or use a different namespace.
- **MCP connection dropped mid-session / tools stop responding.** Monolith runs in-process inside the editor. A dropped connection means the editor closed or crashed. Restart the editor; `monolith_status()` confirms when it is back. While the editor is down you are not blind: run read-only queries through the offline tools. `Binaries/monolith_query.exe` is the canonical standalone executable, and `Scripts/monolith_offline.py` is a stdlib-only fallback kept byte-identical to it. Both serve the `source`, `project`, and `monolith` subcommands plus all 20 Reflection-Intelligence actions (cppreflect, network, decision, risk) against the on-disk databases, byte-identical to the live server. They are read-only — write operations still require the editor.
- **"Plugin 'X' not found" / "Unable to find plugin."** A referenced sibling plugin is not installed. Monolith's sibling plugins ship separately and are **not** in the Monolith release zip. Install the sibling, or drop the dependency.
- **"Unknown action" on a namespace you do have.** You guessed the action name. Call `monolith_discover("<namespace>")` to list the real action names — never invent them.
- **Reflective-write errors from `bulk_fill_query("apply")`** (bad field path, type mismatch, out-of-range value). Call `describe_query("schema", target_namespace=..., target=...)` first to read the exact field paths, ImportText grammar, enum values, and clamp ranges, then re-issue the write to match.

## skills_map

Monolith ships a set of Claude Code **skills** — task-scoped instruction files that load automatically when their trigger words appear in your conversation. They live in the plugin's `Skills/` directory and load through Claude Code **independently of the MCP action surface**: the skill teaches workflow, the MCP namespace executes it. If you are not running through Claude Code, read the skill markdown directly.

`unreal-performance` spans namespaces (config audit, material shader stats, mesh draw-call analysis) rather than mapping one-to-one. The skill set grows between releases — read the plugin's `Skills/` directory for the current roster rather than relying on a fixed count here.

## gotchas

Monolith-specific traps not covered by general Unreal documentation:

- **`build_material_graph` and `bulk_fill_query` want a wrapper object.** `build_material_graph` requires `{ "graph_spec": { ... } }` — a bare spec is rejected. Likewise read each spec builder's schema; the payload is nested under a named key, not passed flat.
- **MCP transport is `"http"`, not `"streamableHttp"`.** When configuring a client, use `"http"`. Nested `params` may serialize to a JSON string in transit — detect that and deserialize back to an object before reading fields.
- **Sibling plugins are absent from the release zip.** The Monolith release zip contains only Monolith. Its sibling plugins (separate repos, separate lifecycles) are not bundled — a live editor with siblings present will report more namespaces than the plugin you installed actually ships. Treat `monolith_discover()` on your own install as the truth for what you have.
- **Optional namespaces register conditionally.** `gas`, `combograph`, `logicdriver`, `ai`, and MetaSound audio actions only appear when their plugin/gate is enabled. A namespace missing from `monolith_discover()` is gated off, not broken — see the **errors** section.
- **For Unreal Engine 5.7 API gotchas** (deprecations, changed signatures, kinematic-velocity asymmetry, package-reuse semantics, and similar), verify against the live engine source via `source_query("search_source", ...)` before writing C++. These are engine-level, not Monolith-specific, so they are not restated here — the source index is the source of truth.
